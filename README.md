# 📻  100 days of podcasts

## Premise

> **Listen to at least one podcast a day for 100 consecutive days**

I came up with this idea while listening to podcast in the shower, what's the worst that could happen if you choose to participate? 😊

## How to participate

1. Select a social media of your choice, preferrably Twitter.
2. Create a post stating that you are participating in the **"100 days of podcasts"** challenge using the _#100daysofpodcasts_ on your preferred social media platform.
3. Everyday post what podcast you are listening to and a link to it (don't forget the _#100daysofpodcasts_ and let us know what day you are on).

## Rules

* You cannot miss a day of listening to a podcast, if you do, you have to start from over.

## List of participants

If you are serious about the challenge, you can add your name to the list of [participants](/participants.md) via a PR

> Best of luck 👏
